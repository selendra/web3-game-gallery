# A Web3 for eSport & Entertainment Industry 
A digital assets wallet management development for eSport and Entertainment Industry.

## Description of Request

A closed loop wallet system, which has the capacity to hold multi-currencies  as well as to receive funds from other source such as bank. 

The wallet will be segregated by the Phone number of the customer. Customers phone number is the account ID of their wallet. 

One master wallet (Counter) will be used to collect revenue from all the wallets. 

The wallet has to be secure and protected from hacking.

Capability to connect to a spot crypto exchange and the PSP at a later stage. 

# Proposition

We propose the wallet holds three different types of currencies/tokens; 

1. KHR pegged which is 1:1 exchange rate to U.S dollar. The customers could buy for their wallet by depositing KHR from their bank account to the wallet via payment service provider to the **Counter** 

2. USD pegged which is also 1:1 exchange rate to USD. Customer acquire this token same as above.

3. Game Token which will have the exchange rate in the future, the more people using and holding it. It could be a speculative investment with some utility. 

Thus, there will not be any exchange rate for the first two, as the transfer is in the same currency from the customerâ€™s bank account to the customers wallet.

    B -->|from Bank Account| C{Counter}
    D --> F(Wallet)
    C -->|Send| D(USD pegged)
```

## Game Token Utility

- As Discount and VIP privilege: Users or customers who hold X amount of the Game Token, will be charged less in transaction fees within the game. 

- As APY return: Users who hold the Game Token could also stake it to the game and earn APY in Game Token. 

- As Investment Asset: Users could cash out to other currencies or crypto at open exchange. 

## KHR and USD pegged utility

Wallet users could utilized these pegged currency to bet in the game, pay each others, receive rewards, or cash out to their bank accounts outside of the wallet.  

## Benefits for Game Operators

For Game Operator, the wallet allow them to hold customers' money within their phone, while the custom cash has already deposited to the Game Operator's bank account.

The cash only return back to the customers when they need to cash out. Though, since the wallet will have the capacity to transfer among themselves and make payment outside, the customer will less likely to take the cash out, but use it for game or buy things at the Operators' partnership stores. 

## Benefits for users
Since the Game operators save money from bank fees, the users/customers could be rewarded via discount program and many more others variety.

## Technology

A Blockchain will be to mint and burn the tokens in the wallet. The Mint function is will take place, when customers transfer CASH from their bank account to buy the currency into the wallet. Burn function is will take place, when they transfer tokens back to their bank account.

Smart contract will be used to automate these functions and many others tasks that will reduce the cost of people time managing the process. At the same time, save cost from running centralized data center or servers to store those data, since the transactions are done over the Blokchain. 

The wallet has to be secure and protected from hacking than a centralized database on data center or centralized cloud because it is used Smart Contract.

The tokens is a blockchain token standard, which ERC-20 token, thus it has the capability to connect to a spot crypto exchange and the PSP, that will open to support it.

# Question to Clarify

- Is the existing game system already in place?

- If so, we do need access to the games in order to understand how integrate the wallets and estimate the time it will take to do it?

- How many tokens/currencies do you need to develop? Please help clarify its nature, for example; stable value 1:1 USD.
